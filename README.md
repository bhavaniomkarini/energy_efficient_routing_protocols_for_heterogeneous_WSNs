# energy_efficient_routing_protocols_for_heterogeneous_WSNs
This is one of my projects in Computer Network. Here, I have analyzed the performance measures of various WSN protocols such as LEECH, SEP, and ZSEP. The node density, dead nodes, alive nodes, and packet to a base station of these three protocols have been tested.
